Metaphor
========

Metaphor is a collection of Perl modules that supports the development and maintenance of a [resource-oriented architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture) (ROA) via [RESTful interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), initially inspired by - but extensively expanded upon - [Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/au/3067)'s 2008 article *[Developing RESTful Web Services in Perl](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2008/02/19/developing-restful-web-services-in-perl.html)*.

Metaphor encourages the [separation of concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) by providing (a) patterns for encapsulating data access business logic in Perl modules, and (b) patterns for exposing resources (the data) externally via web services.
